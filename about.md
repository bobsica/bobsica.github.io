Hello, I'm Bob Sica. Welcome to what passes for my fun side. To read more about my work side (lidars and university professing), click over to the [Purple Crow Lidar blog](http://pclblog.bobsica.com).

I often like to talk with pictures instead of words like. I am an extremely unserious photographer (especially for a physicist who has taught optics). My photos are taken with iPhones, my only camera. A select few of these end up [on VSCO](http://vsco.co/bobsica/images/1), or for mass consumption square on [my Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/bob.sica/).

Thanks for reading!

## Setup

Built on the back of giants:

* Move to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) inspired by a fave science blog [Pauline's perambulations and permutations](http://pbarmby.github.io).
* Base template is poole: [https://github.com/poole/poole/](https://github.com/poole/poole/). 
* Many thanks to Joshua Lande who's [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) made a good thing even better.
