## Setup

Built on the back of giants:

* Base template is poole: [https://github.com/poole/poole/](https://github.com/poole/poole/). 
* Many thanks to Joshua Lande who's [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) made a good thing even better.

Thanks for reading!
