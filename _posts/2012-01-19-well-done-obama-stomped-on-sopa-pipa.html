<div class="posterous_autopost">So maybe it was worth waiting for a bit or "Roar Lion Roar" from the White House the last few years?

Hope you enjoy being able to see Neil and the Famly dancing because if SOPA were ever to happen you couldnâ€™t!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="417" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SrSmtC0Skg4?wmode=transparent" width="500"></iframe></div></div>
