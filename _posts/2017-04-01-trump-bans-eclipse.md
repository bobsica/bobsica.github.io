President Trump today extended his controversial travel ban to include our closest star, The Sun. The travel ban now includes the eclipsing of solar system objects in a manner that "decreases luminosity reaching the soil of the USA or its territories." This order effectively eliminates the potentially deliberate action of our Moon to completely block sunlight from reaching the surface, impacting the lives of millions of Americans, on August 17, 2017. White House Press Sean Spicer said when questioned:

    The decisive action of The President today again shows his commitment
    to protecting the environment by stopping global cooling, increasing
    argiculture productivity, and protecting jobs for solar astronomers
    threatened by big business in China.  

In a statement President Trump said:

    The Sun knows its job and has a duty to warm America. Real warm.
    Big league warm, I'll tell you why. CAUSE TRAVELLING TO FLORIDA
    EVERY WEEKEND SUCKS. Got that, more Sun, warmer in DC, better for
    my golf game. So if the Sun thinks it is going to waltz over the
    border from Canada and turn itself off over the USA in the middle
    of summer it can screw off.
    
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tweeted, apparently in response to Trump's action:

    CDN all for Sun expressing itself how if feels most comfortable.
    Hot or Cool CDN loves u & welcomes u & all stellar objects! #eclipe2017
