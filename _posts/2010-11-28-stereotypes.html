I love stereotypes. What I mean is a love when a stereotype is a <br />stereotype because it is correct. I'm particularly stoked tonight as I <br />think I got just about all of 'em out of my system in less than 6 hrs <br />in Switzerland. <p /> In no particularly order. <p /> Saw a St. Bernard (no barrel around neck; oh year Amy P a beagle too. <br />Also Euro dogs, hanging out in malls/trains/etc, hey that's one too). <br />None of the dogs were smoking. <p /> Saw a Swiss Army knife store. <p /> Saw Swiss Balls in a furniture store. <p /> My hotel has Lindt and Tolberone bars. And Ricola (only one I missed <br />today was the guys with the long horns cause...) <p /> On the train connecting gates at the Airport they projected on the <br />tunnel walls at one point a short video that had both a hot "Swiss <br />Miss" in the hot "Swiss Miss" outfit smiling and waving, plus a cow <br />moo'ing in the background. Would have made Mrs. Sica homesick. <p /> General Euro stereotype: walking back from dinner saw a student <br />protest about who knows what, with the riot police in full kit <br />following them. Why I don't know, they were politely writing their <br />slogans in chalk. <p /> Everything by the train tracks was tagged in Zurich, many with the F <br />word (en anglais). <p /> Ikea, MacDonalds, Burger King, Starbucks (had a lunch in Zurich, 2 <br />close to the hotel here), H&amp;M (well they are Swedish). <p /> Asked directions in a Swatch store. <p /> etc. <p /> PO, <br />boB <p /> ps: torn between iPad or an 11" MBA? 15 min after getting off the <br />train in Bern I had 300 mb of 3G iPad data for $20 including a <br />microsim card. Try that with an Air! <p /> ppss Chey, check out these Cons, an American icon how'd Switzerland <br />get all the leather/faux fur lined ones including the knee highs (see <br />photo). <p /> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pUa99K-JiT67gARU5gIAlg?feat=directlink&amp;fgl=true&amp;pli=1">http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pUa99K-JiT67gARU5gIAlg?feat=directlink&amp;f...</a>
