I haven’t had time to read or watch Game of Thrones, but css assures me the books are excellent so maybe I will sometime. I’ve got 5 min to hear the theme played by Phil Lesh and the Terrapin Family Band. As a DeadHead what I love is seeing Phil so engaged watching his boys give ‘er. The best part of parenting is when you get those chances to share experiences with those young adults who you have known all their life.<br /><div class="attribution"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DttQVD5-lrA?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div>
