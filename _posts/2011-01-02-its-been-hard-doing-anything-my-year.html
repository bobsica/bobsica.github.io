<span style="font-size: small;">Magnolia Electric Company’s Jason Molina did the heavy stuff lifting, some thoughts from me in italics.&nbsp;</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Almost Was Good Enough (Once)</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">It’s been hard doing anything</span><span style="font-size: small;">winter stuck around so long</span><span style="font-size: small;">I kept trying anyhow and I’m still trying now</span><span style="font-size: small;">just to keep working just to keep working</span><span style="font-size: small;">I remember when it didn’t use to be so hard<em> (newsflash: 55 just ain’t the new 33, don’t believe the hype)</em></span><span style="font-size: small;">this used to be impossible <em>(no longer for sure)</em></span><span style="font-size: small;">A new season has to begin</span><span style="font-size: small;">I can feel it leaning in whispering “Nothing’s lonely now”</span><span style="font-size: small;">Nothing anymore in pain <em>(No Pain, maybe I’ll write that down for the bag at the turn around in OK Falls on the run. With my can of Red Bull)</em></span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: small;"><em></em></span><span style="font-size: small;">A tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress</span><span style="font-size: small;">when they want everyone to know that they ‘re around</span><span style="font-size: small;">leaning in whispering “my friend over there</span><span style="font-size: small;">don’t know what [s]he’s talking about” <em>(and I will trust her wisdom on this one, in case you’re wondering)</em></span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: small;">Did you really believe</span><span style="font-size: small;">that everyone makes it out? <em>(we are all not winners. never forget that)</em></span><span style="font-size: small;">Almost no one makes it out <em>(I say this over and over on those long ugly rides and every 30 s after 3 hr on the run)</em></span><span style="font-size: small;">I’m going to use that street to hide</span><span style="font-size: small;">from that human doubt</span><span style="font-size: small;">to hide from what was shining</span><span style="font-size: small;">and has finally burned us out</span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: small;"></span><span style="font-size: small;">But if no one makes it out</span><span style="font-size: small;">How come you’re talking to one right now</span><span style="font-size: small;">for once almost was good enough <em>(for once in 2008, but that was long ago and its 2011 and there is still a very bad taste on my lips, that I’m hoping will keep me thirsty until I can drink at the well Aug 28).</em></span></blockquote><span style="font-size: small;"><em>So tomorrow my journey begins. I am completely detached from it at this point. Just one of my parallel universes that we all drift through. Nothing to see here people until at least June.
