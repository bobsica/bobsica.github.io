![Run GMC.](https://bobsica/public/runGMC.jpg)

While the Girl could only have a brief stay in LndOnt the Boy and Run GMC are still around. Run GMC is the Boy's mobile operations centre, complete with bedroom, living room and the latest project in progress today: a kitchen. Although older than the Boy himself, Run GMC would have made [Mr. T and the A-team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team "!w the a team - Google Search") proud by making it all the way home on an extended road trip back from the Left Coast.

Mrs. Sica was amazed by this happenstance and remarked in verse:

    Long may you run.
    Long may you run.
    Although these changes
    Have come
    With your chrome heart shining
    In the sun
    Long may you run
   
   which will be well know to you Neil Young fans ([listen](musics://itunes.apple.com/mx/album/long-may-you-run/id306292060?l=en "long may you run itunes - Google Search") ).
   
   All me and the Girl can say is:
   
    Gonna live, POSITIVE, forever, AND EVER
    Run-G[sic].M.C. and we're "Tougher Than Leather".
    
   
   Stay strong Run GMC.
