<div>Long day and physical/mental collapse loom so in new world order.Â </div><p /><div>On the run today I finally realize why art is different from science and why we like it.</div> <p /><div>Back to that, on the run it was snowy, first snow run of the year. Up river like Kurtz got to the Baren Park. SOB they do have bears here, in this tiered hillside with a moat at the bottom and a fence at the top 3 of the fabled Bears of Bern and this Tiger ate his hat, you weren&#039;t kidding KW. Mamma Brownie with 2 cubs having a grand old time doing the bear thing with a few gronking tourist and an old guy who didn&#039;t even slow down, I mean in Fairbanks this would be common place, PPPAATTTTT, where&#039;s the magnum that bar&#039; is back in the yard again.</div> <p /><div>What does that have to do with art, simple cause I was on the run heading downriver, and got on these lonely snow covered trails in a flurry with the sun popping in and out and Weather Report Suite never sounding better (as if that could happen) and a pelican flew by (cold for a pelican I would have thought) and Crows (not my Crows, locals) crying.</div> <p /><div>And yeah and more Euro-dogs, one woman leading about a DOZEN dogs all well behaved, big doggy dogs and ALL off-lead, I ran right through them, wow.</div><p /><div>So I thinking I&#039;m happy and how it resonated with me and it all became clear in the moment people, about how similar happiness and resonance are. When it&#039;s good it is on and you know it. So I think what happens is we like different stimulus, whether art, music, food, whatever because we are all similar in the frequencies we experience, but all different in how these frequencies interact with us, you know, in the broad picture we experience the same frequency envelope but our uniqueness is in what grabs us in narrow little happy bands, like Jerry&#039;s guitar or running hard up the big hill home. And my frequencies peak (shift) to just slightly different places then yours. It is why are molecules are in a sense different and how they interact so we are just systems of these systems so I don&#039;t see that this is much of a stretch. These resonances are deeper then our conscious brain, which mucks up everything anyway by trying to explain, explain, explain.</div> <p /><div>No one tell Paul Harvey this, cause it is at the rest of the story and he might be dead anyway?</div><p /><div>So Were-wolfs of London, Bears of Bern, Tiger of Tenafly, Mustangs of Western etc, I&#039;m almost out of here. But this is Bern and this is where in 1905 as a young, probably considered eccentric kind of guy named Albert Einstein, who was as famous at the time as that mosquito you killed last July, was a patent clerk here, and he walked these same streets and realized if you ran with a mirror at the speed of light you couldn&#039;t see yourself in it and the rest is history.</div> <p /><div>So on the way to the meeting today we, I realized, I had resonated in the same place, only separated only by time. And yeah we had a good science chat as well at the Meeting!</div><p /><div><div class="lyrics_text" style="font-size:14px;line-height:19px;"> <b>&quot;</b>Winter grey and falling rain, we&#039;ll see summer come again,<br />Darkness falls and seasons change (gonna happen every time).<br />Same old friends the wind and rain, Summers fade and roses die,<br />You&#039;ll see summer come again, Like a song that&#039;s born to soar the sky.&quot;</div> <p /><div class="lyrics_text" style="font-size:14px;line-height:19px;">boB<br /><p /></div></div><div> <br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><a href="http://bobsica.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/photo.jpg"><img alt="Photo" height="435" src="http://bobsica.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/photo.jpg?w=300" width="580" /></a><br/></div><br/></div>
