<a href="http://road.cc/content/news/120731-huge-200-bike-theft-scott-headquarters-switzerland" target="_blank" title="">Huge 200-bike theft at Scott headquarters in Switzerland | road.cc</a>  <br/><br/>No small theft, these bikes were worth an average of CHF 4,500 each and included 2015 prototypes. And to think this happened just outside Fribourg.  I feel bad for someone who just ordered a bike and has has to deal with this. The dealers as well. I hope thy nail the thieves soon. <br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"><a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" />Posted with Blogsy</a></div>
