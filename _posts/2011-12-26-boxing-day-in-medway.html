<div class="posterous_autopost">We got a beautiful, really Fall-like day today on Boxing Day (or Wrestling Day as it is known to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32CwrOZVobo" target="_blank" title="12 days of Christmas">Doug and Bob</a>). The kids went skating down in the Park and we brought our coffee cups over to a lookout on the Medway. If you saw the "teaser" video I posted from there you could hear how quiet and so how pretty it was. So I had some fun with the camera.<br /><br />Oh right, Americans Boxing Day is the day Canadians bring small gifts to there servants for the hard work for them preparing our feasts on the previous day. In our case we gave them the morning off as well, but that's just us!<br /><br /><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><br /><a href="http://flic.kr/s/aHsjHcAzjt" target="_blank">See 8 photos from our walk on Flickr.</a></div></div>
