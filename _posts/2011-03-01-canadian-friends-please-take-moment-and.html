The private member's bill, introduced by Parkdale-High Park MPP <a href="http://www.cheridinovo.ca/" title="Cheri DiNovo's Website" target="_blank"><strong>Cheri DiNovo</strong></a>, is intended to make Ontario's roadways safer for cyclists by requiring motorists to give cyclists a wide berth when passing (between 3 and 5 feet depending on the motorist's speed).  Fines for motorists breaking this law would range from $310 to $750.</p><br/>      	<p>On December 10, 2010 Bill 93 received Royal Assent making Nova Scotia the first Canadian Province to enact a one-metre safe passing law.  Sixteen US States have 3-foot laws in effect, including Arkansas, Florida, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Illinois, Tennessee, Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin, Arizona, Oklahoma, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland and Maine.  When passed, Bill 74 will make Ontario the second Canadian province with this type of law.      	  </p><br/>      	<p>Information on the bill itself can be found <a href="http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Intranet=&amp;BillID=2364" title="Bill 74, Highway Traffic Amendment Act" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.      	  </p><br/>      	<p>Information on cyclists run down by motorists can be found <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2010/05/14/quebec-cycling-accident.html" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a> and <strong> <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Spate cycling accidents leads advocates call public education/3580334/story.html" title="Ottawa Citizen" target="_blank">HERE</a></strong> and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/09/10/ottawa-hit-and-run-cyclist.html" title="CBC News" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p><br/>      	<p>If you support Bill 74, please fill out the form below.
